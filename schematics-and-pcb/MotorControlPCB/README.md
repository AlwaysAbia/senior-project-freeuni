# The layout for the second PCB of the project 

- The PCB will be placed just below the first one.
- It contains 3 Stepper Motor Drivers and 6 Connectors
- 3 of the connectors are the motor signal pins (Which are thick and dual traced for power reasons)
- the other 3 are for the mottor signals STEP and DIR coming from the Top PCB
- Includes 2 Power Pads also coming from the Top PCB (Straight from the battery), powering the drivers.
- Will hand solder a 100uF cap at the PWR pads
